      <h3>Drug Recall Tracker (in progress)</h3>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm currently trying to make a simple software tool to help track drug recalls in a pharmaceutical company. The idea is to improve how we manage and follow up on product recalls. I'm still learning how to build the interface and make it easy to use.

      <h3>Antimicrobial Study</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, I tested the antimicrobial activity of methanol root bark extracts from Salvadora persica (also known as the toothbrush tree). The extracts were tested on both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to see how effective they were. I used this study as part of my research work.
